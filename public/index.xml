      <description>On tuesday, I was one of 250 attendees of the first virtual „European Networking Day&amp;quot;. This event was brought to life by the organizers of the European Cloud Conference and European Collaboration Summit. I spent almost 5 hours in virtual reality (the event was organized using AltspaceVR) and really had a great time, so I thought it would be nice to do a quick recap for everyone that couldn&amp;rsquo;t attend or for others planning to do such events in the future.</description>

      <description>This year, I attended my very first Microsoft Ignite in Orlando, Florida. Besides some very interesting announcements (I’ll cover the most important ones from my point of view in the second part), I thought it would be nice to share some advice for other &amp;ldquo;newcomers&amp;rdquo; when they go for their first Microsoft Ignite…
Plan your schedule ahead! Plan your schedule weeks in advance. I didn’t plan my sessions until each morning, which led to nervous looking-at-my-phone-while-walking in the morning and searching-for-the-next-session while sitting in another session – both of which is quite distracting.</description>
