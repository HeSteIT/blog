      <description>On tuesday, I was one of 250 attendees of the first virtual â€žEuropean Networking Day&amp;quot;. This event was brought to life by the organizers of the European Cloud Conference and European Collaboration Summit. I spent almost 5 hours in virtual reality (the event was organized using AltspaceVR) and really had a great time, so I thought it would be nice to do a quick recap for everyone that couldn&amp;rsquo;t attend or for others planning to do such events in the future.</description>
